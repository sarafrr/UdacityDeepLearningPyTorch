    "  \n",
    "1. We discard some of the text to have the batch filled completely  \n",
    "Each batch contains $NxM$ characters, $N$ is the `batch_size` and $M$ the `seq_length`.  \n",
    "To have the number of batches, $K$, we divide the length of `arr` (number of elements in the original sequence) by the number of characters per batch.  \n",
    "So, you know the total number of characters to keep from `arr`: $NxMxK$.  \n",

    "We know we want $N$ sequences in a batch, so let's make that the size of the first dimension. For the second dimension, you can use -1 as a placeholder in the size, it'll fill up the array with the appropriate data for you. After this, you should have an array that is $Nx(M*K)$.  \n",

    "For each subsequent batch, the window moves over by `seq_length` (horizontally, it moves on). We also want to create both the input and target arrays. Remember that the targets are just the inputs shifted over by one character. The way I like to do this window is use range to take steps of size `n_steps` from `0` to `arr.shape[1]`, the total number of tokens for each input. That way, the integers you get from range always point to the start of a batch, and each window is `seq_length` wide."
