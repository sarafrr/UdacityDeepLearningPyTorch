# UdacityDeepLearningPyTorch
Exercises and projects given in the Deep Learning ND program offered by Udacity.com.
## Overview
The following topics will be addressed:
1. the concept of **tensors** which is the *main data structure of PyTorch* and *how tensors interact with **NumPy** Python package*.
2. the PyTorch module named **autograd** *to calculate gradients for training neural networks*. It is able to *perform backpropagation by calculating the gradients at each operation in the network*
3. we will *build a neural network* and *do the forward propagation*
4. we will *define a **loss*** and an **optimization method** to *train a neural neywork* (on a dataset of handwritten digits)
5. we will understand *how to test how a neural network is able to generalize* using the **validation** procedure
6. we will see that your neural network is not able to work well with more complex images, so we will learn a technique named **transfer learning**: *to use pre-trained networks to improve the performances of your classifier*
